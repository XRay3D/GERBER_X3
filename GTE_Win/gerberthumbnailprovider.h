The code sample demonstrates the C++ implementation of a thumbnail handler
for a new file type registered with the .recipe extension.

A thumbnail image handler provides an image to represent the item. It lets
you customize the thumbnail of files with a specific file extension. Windows
Vista and newer operating systems make greater use of file-specific thumbnail
images than earlier versions of Windows. Thumbnails of 32-bit resolution and
as large as 256x256 pixels are often used. File format owners should be
prepared to display their thumbnails at that size.

The example thumbnail handler implements the IInitializeWithStream and
IThumbnailProvider interfaces, and provides thumbnails for .recipe files.
The .recipe file type is simply an XML file registered as a unique file name
extension. It includes an element called "Picture", embedding an image file.
The thumbnail handler extracts the embedded image and asks the Shell to
display it as a thumbnail.
