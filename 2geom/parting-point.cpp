    /* The ladder algorithm takes steps along the two paths, as if they the stiles of
     * an imaginary ladder. Note that the nodes (X) on boths paths may not coincide:
     *
     * paths[0] START--------X-----------X-----------------------X---------X----> ...
     * paths[1] START--------------X-----------------X-----------X--------------> ...
     *
     * The variables pos[0], pos[1] are the indices of the nodes we've cleared so far;
     * i.e., we know that the portions before pos[] overlap.
     *
     * In each iteration of the loop, we move to the next node along one of the paths;
     * the variable `leg` tells us which path. We find the point nearest to that node
     * on the first unprocessed curve of the other path and check the curve time.
     *
     * Suppose the current node positions are denoted by P; one possible location of
     * the nearest point (N) to the next node is:
     *
     * ----P------------------N--X---- paths[!leg]
     * --------P--------------X------- paths[leg] (we've stepped forward from P to X)
     *
     * We detect this situation when we find that the curve time of N is < 1.0.
     * We then create a trimmed version of the top curve so that it corresponds to
     * the current bottom curve:
     *
     * ----P----------------------N--X---------- paths[!leg]
     *         [------------------]              trimmed curve
     * --------P------------------X------------- paths[leg]
     *
     * Using isNear(), we can compare the trimmed curve to the front curve (P--X) on
     * paths[leg]; if they are indeed near, then pos[leg] can be incremented.
     *
     * Another possibility is that we overstep the end of the other curve:
     *
     * ----P-----------------X------------------ paths[!leg]
     *                       N
     * --------P------------------X------------- paths[leg]
     *
     * so the nearest point N now coincides with a node on the top path. We detect
     * this situation by observing that the curve time of N is close to 1. In case
     * of such overstep, we change legs by flipping the `leg` variable:
     *
     * ----P-----------------X------------------ paths[leg]
     * --------P------------------X------------- paths[!leg]
     *
     * We can now continue the stepping procedure, but the next step will be taken on
     * the path `paths[leg]`, so it should be a shorter step (if it isn't, the paths
     * must have diverged and we're done):
     *
     * ----P-----------------X------------------ paths[leg]
     * --------P-------------N----X------------- paths[!leg]
     *
     * Another piece of data we hold on to are the curve times on the current curves
     * up until which the paths have been found to coincide. In other words, at every
     * step of the algorithm we know that the curves agree up to the path-times
     * PathTime(pos[i], curve_times[i]).
     *
     * In the situation mentioned just above, the times (T) will be as follows:
     *
     * ----P---T-------------X------------------ paths[leg]
     *
     * --------P-------------N----X------------- paths[!leg]
     *         T
     *
     * In this example, the time on top path is > 0.0, since the T mark is further
     * ahead than P on that path. This value of the curve time is needed to correctly
     * crop the top curve for the purpose of the isNear() comparison:
     *
     * ----P---T-------------X---------- paths[leg]
     *         [-------------]           comparison curve (cropped from paths[leg])
     *         [-------------]           comparison curve (cropped from paths[!leg])
     * --------P-------------N----X----- paths[!leg]
     *         T
     *
     * In fact, the lower end of the curve time range for cropping is always
     * given by curve_times[i].
     *
     * The iteration ends when we find that the two paths have diverged or when we
     * reach the end. When that happens, the positions and curve times will be
     * the PathTime components of the actual point of divergence on both paths.
